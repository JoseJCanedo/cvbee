We won last year and several other years in the past and we get a fair bit of great publicity for the club from the event. However, we need volunteers to be able to do this event. We have to order out tree no later than Nov 15th, 2025 if we are to participate. Decorating days would be December 3rd, and 4th from 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM. The lighting of the trees is scheduled for December 5th from 6:00 - 7:00 PM. Then the tree should be un-decorated no later than January 5th, 2026. If no one is interested in participating the club will not participate.',
